Welcome to my Noah's Pet Clinic Multimedia Project. 

The website is linked to two MySQL databases, accessed from the 'Our Services' and 'Contact Us' website pages. 


Our Services:

This page uses PHP code which allows you to search a database of NPC's services, using the drop down menu. Please use the 'services.csv'
file to create this database on your server. In my code, the database is called 'npc', and the table is called 'services'.
PHP file: process_servicesearch.php


Contact Us: 

This page uses PHP code which allows you to add your contact details to NPC's database by filling in the form and clicking 'Submit Query'. 
Therefore, the database does not need existing records for it to work. Please use the 'contact.csv' file to import the table headings and 
some sample data. In my code, the database is called 'npc', and the table is called 'custinfo' 
PHP file: process_insertcontactinfo.php


Home page name: index.php
