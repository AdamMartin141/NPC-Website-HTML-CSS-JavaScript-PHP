    <h1 class = "homeHeadings"> About Us: </h1>
  <p class = "subHeading"> Noah's Pet Clinic is a small, independent pet clinic based in the beautiful village of High Lane in the
    Peak District, just a 30 minute drive from Manchester City Center. The clinic can trace its roots back to 2007, when our 
    brilliant CEO, Jayne Smith, realized her lifelong dream of opening her very own pet clinic, Noah's Pet Clinic! Since then, 
    the surgery has grown into one of the most renowned vet clinics in the Manchester area, winning numerous awards along the way. </p>		
	
	<p class = "subHeading"> Our highly skilled and trained vet doctors specialise in treating all animals, from
  dogs and cats to mice and gerbils. At Noah's Pet Clinic, we understand how important your pets are, and strive to give all of our pets
  the best possible care every day. We offer a range of services, including regular check ups, surgical procedures, flea treatments and 
  vaccinations, and are always on the lookout for new pets to care for. We understand that choosing who to care for your pet's health is 
  one of life's most important decisions. We think we are the best choice, but why not pop in to the clinic to check us out for yourself, 
  or give us a call on 0161 123 4567, to book a free consultation with one of our highly trained vet doctors.</p>
