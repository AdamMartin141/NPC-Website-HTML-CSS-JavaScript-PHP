  <h1 class = "homeHeadings"> Our Team </h1>
  <p class = "subHeading2"> Here at Noah's Pet Clinic, we believe that the key to amazing animal care is a great team of staff. That is why we have 
  taken care to hire only the best staff, from receptionists to vet doctors and nurses. Every member of the team is passionate about animals, and is 
  fully committed to providing great care and customer service. Take a moment to meet some of the team below! </p>

    <div class = "staffDescriptionsBox">
    <p class = "staffDescriptions"> While working as a vet, Jayne decided that she would like to start a practice
      of her own one day. This dream became a reality in 2007, when Noah's Pet Clinic was born! Jayne has been the driving force
      behind the clinic's success ever since. She loves caring for animals, and making customers happy by treating their pets.
      Outside the clinic, Jayne enjoys walking her three Golden Retrievers, and spending time with her family. </p>

      between studying and her role at the clinic. She hopes to use her degree to become a full-time vet doctor one day! When she isn't
      organizing appointments and updating pet records, Elanor enjoys fulfilling her passion for horses. She is also a keen sportswoman,
      and captain of her local hockey team.

      animals during childhood, when her family managed a farm. Helen channeled this passion into a degree in Veterinary Science, and has worked in
      vet practices since graduation. Besides caring for animals, Helen loves travelling, and experiencing new cultures (and meeting new animals along
      the way!) </p>

      Clinic ever since. A trip to the zoo when he was just 5 years old inspired his animal career. He loves his job, and finds looking after animals
      extremely rewarding. On weekends, Gary enjoys watching his beloved Manchester City, and playing as a striker for his local
      football team. </p>
